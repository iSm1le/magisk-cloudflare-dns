# Magisk Cloudflare DNS

[![Developer web site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Developer%20site-xaked.com-blue.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square)](https://xaked.com/)

This module makes your device to use Cloudflare's DNS servers instead of the provided by the ISP:
* 1.1.1.1
* 1.0.0.1

It is not guaranteed to work on cellular networks on all devices. Some users/testers say yes, others say that it doesn't.
On Wi-Fi it always works though.

If you know how to make it always work on cellular networks and want to contribute, please do!

## Notice
* Take a full backup before installing the module.
* You should use latest Magisk Manager to install this module. If you meet any problem under installation from Magisk Manager, please try to install it from recovery.
